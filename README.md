# bus-mall

**Bus-Mall** is a project we did for model 3 from code 201 bus mall is similar to SkyMall catalog found in the seatback pockets on airplanes: a catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel. The difference with BusMall is that instead of their catalog being placed in airplanes, they are placed on local busses while commuting through traffic.

## The code 

in app.js the code will create object for each product with its name and the path:

* Render the image in the web page

* Make sure that there is not dublicate images in the same iteration

* Make sure that the images are not repeated for each iteration

* Get the user perfered product by clicking in the images

* Display list of of products with number of votes and number of time it's shown

* Visulaize the Data for the user using Chart.js library 

* Adding local storage to save user data

* The user can vote 25 time
